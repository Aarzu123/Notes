Case study 1:

Suppose we are developing a car rental system, where users can rent cars from a rental agency. The system should be able to handle different types of cars, including sedans, SUVs, and luxury cars. Each car should have a unique ID, a make and model, a year, and a rental price per day. Here's how we could implement this system using OOP concepts:



Objects: We will create objects for each car and rental agency.



Classes: We will create two classes, one for the car and one for the rental agency. The car class will have attributes such as ID, make, model, year, and rental price per day. The rental agency class will have attributes such as name, location, and a list of available cars.



Encapsulation: We will encapsulate the car class by making its attributes private and providing public methods to access and modify them.



Abstraction: We will abstract the system by creating a rental system that handles the car rental process and hides the details of how the cars are stored and managed.



Inheritance: We can create different types of cars by inheriting from the car class. For example, we can create a luxury car class that inherits from the car class and adds additional attributes such as leather seats and GPS.



Polymorphism: We can use polymorphism to handle different types of cars in the rental system. For example, we can define a rental method in the car class, which can be overridden in the luxury car class to include additional charges.



Overloading: We can define multiple constructors in the car class to handle different ways of initializing a car object, such as passing in all the attributes or just the make and model.



Overriding: We can override the rental method in the luxury car class to include additional charges for its extra features.
